# BoostRunner
#### Mohamed Yusuf Osman
### Android for	java	programmers	2016
																																					

The	basic	idea	of BoostRunner is	that a	new	user	enters his	name, weight,	length	properties and	If	it’s	a male	
or	female.	This	gets	stored in	a	database.	This	should	occur only	the first time	the	app	is	used	
for	example after	downloading	from	play	store.	
When	user	starts	a running/walking	activity a	timer should	start	with	time,	distance,	Calories
burned	and	if	the	person	has	network	it should	also	track	the	user	in	map	and	also	present	
some	kind	of	trophy	or	something	funny	and	motivating	 when	person	reaches	certain	
distance,	this	is	to	motivate	the	person	to keep	going	and	not	to	stop.
